**Help Us Publish Our First Translation of Contemporary Poetry**

At *The Cat Translations* and the Argentine publisher *Litoral Dark* we are launching our first translation and publishing project: an independent, self-managed edition to bring the work of a remarkable contemporary poet to Spanish-speaking readers.

Your support will make this translation possible, covering rights, editing, design, and printing.

To donate and collaborate:
📌 From Argentina (ARS): [MERCADO PAGO](link.mercadopago.com.ar/thecatranslations)
📌 From outside Argentina (USD): [AIRTM](airtm.me/micaela1d8tfnfp)

🎁 Be part of the book: After donating, email us at [info@thecat.ar](mailto:info@thecat.ar)with your name, donation information and how you'd like to appear in the acknowledgments.

*Thank you for supporting translation and independent publishing!*
