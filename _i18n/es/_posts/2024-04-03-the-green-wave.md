“From here on, the green wave continues”.
As long as we don’t know what this sign means,
as long as we don’t know,
we are going to think of the green wave
of the _talas_ and the _ceibos_ from the province,
in the green wave of the flax fields,
in the green wave of the wetland in summer, 
in the misleading green of the marshes.
As long as we don’t know.
Perhaps the green wave that begins in _Pueyrredón_
means a row of traffic lights
giving a faster way to cars,
maybe the fierce buses run
after the wave.
The sign is what determines our world
but as long as we don’t know 
what it indicates, 
let’s imagine the pastures,
the sea waves on some beaches of Uruguay,
the sugar canes moving in the wind,
all the green waves of the world,
and let’s forget that maybe this sign, 
this citizen code,
has no other function
than to regulate the mechanical waves 
so that the cars 
move faster, safer
on road to nowhere, towards no destination,
towards the slow day coming after us 
in drops of petroleum among rage and violence.
